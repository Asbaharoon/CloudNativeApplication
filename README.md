## Cloud Native Application 

### User Functionality

User Creation: Send the POST request http://localhost:8080/user/register, if user doesnot exists user gets created with message "Registered Succesfully", else we get message "User already exists" .

Send the Get request http://localhost:8080/ and select Basic Auth after succesfully authenticating the request we get the current time else error message will be displayed "Unauthorised".

### Note Functionality 

* As a user, only I should be able to perform CRUD operations on my note.
* As a user, I must be authentication to the application and authorized on the note (i.e. I must be the owner of the note).
* As a user, I should be able to create a new note.
* As a user, I should be able to update a note that I have created.
* As a user, I should be able to delete a note that I have created.
* As a user, I should be able to get all note that I have created.
* As a user, I should be able to get a note that I have created.

| Endpoint | Request Type | Functionality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /note | GET | Get all notes for a User |
| /note | POST | Create a note for the user |
| /note/{idNotes} | GET | Get note for the user |
| /note/{idNotes} | PUT | Update a note for the user |
| /note/{idNotes} | DELETE | Delete a note for the user |

### Attachment Functionality 

* As a user, I want to add, update or delete attachements to my notes. I should be authenticated & authorized to be able to perform these operations.
* As a user, I want to add a attachements to my note. You must support any docs for attachements.
* As a user, I want to update attachements attached to note. Updating attachements should replace existing attachements.
* As a user, I want to delete attachements attached to note.
* As a user, I expect attachments to be stored in Amazon S3 bucket when the application is running on cloud (when running in EC2 instance). When the application is running locally on developerâ€™s machine you must store attachments in a local temporary directory.
* Metadata about attachements attached to my note should be stored in RDBMS such as MySQL.

## Deploy Instructions

* Run the CircleCI build then the code will be deployed in EC2
* Hit the Public DNS of EC2 follwed by application name (here CloudApp)
* Perform CRUD operations on User, Notes and Attachments on Postman and check whether Application is working.


## Unit Tests
The CloudappApplicationTests Junit file which is present in Test folder.

## CI
CircleCI is Continuous Integration, a development practice which is being used by software teams allowing them to to build, test and deploy applications easier and quicker on multiple platforms.

## CD 
AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of compute services such as Amazon EC2.You can use AWS CodeDeploy to automate software deployments, eliminating the need for error-prone manual operations. The service scales to match your deployment needs.

### Trigger CircleCI Build Using API

```
curl -u TOKEN \
     -d build_parameters[CIRCLE_JOB]=build \
     https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/tejasparikh/csye6225-spring2019-ami/tree/master
